=  README for ex9: Asteroids Game
=============================


==================
=  Description:  =
==================
This program runs an Asteroid game that works by the games rules.
It includes 3 classes:
    1. Asteroid Class: defining an Asteroid in the game.
    2. Ship Class: defining a ship in the game
    3. Torpedo Class: Defining a torpedo in the class
also includes an asteroids_main file that manages the whole game progress.

NOTE: unlike the school solution, you can't die and win at the same time.
if you run out of life, you LOSE, period.

======================
1. We were thinking to give to the asteroid the random place inside it's
   class. the benefit of defining inside the class is logic because it's part
   of the asteroid properties. an asteroid should be on a random place and the
   person who is using this class shouldn't think about how it's done
  (design by contract) and add a method to know if it's in a specific position.
   we choose the other way because then we can compare it's place to the ship's
   place in a better and more comfortable way.
2. We were considering makeing another class called Asteroids that will be an
   object of asteroids in the game. the class will do all the actions we did
   inside the game manager with the Asteroids (add, remove, move and more)
   and will be instead of the list. it's more organized and much more readable
   but we choose the other option because there are not so many actions to do
   and it seemed more easy to manage it with a list.

3. When firing the torpedo, we made the ship fire the torpedo from it's tip
   (with the same speed and heading) and then the gamerunner accelerate
   and move it.
   It's helpful because if we need to suddenly change the way the torpedo moves
   we won't have to change function within the objects themself, and only
   change how the game treats them.
   It's also useful if we want to use the ship and torpedo for a different game
   if we wish so, as they make no assumption about the movement inside the game
